    commands:
      status:
        frozen: |-
          The VM is frozen. To start it, you can run `vagrant up`, or you can
          instead run `vagrant destroy` to delete it and discard all saved state.
        stopped: |-
          The VM is stopped. To start it, you can run `vagrant up`, or you can
          instead run `vagrant destroy` to delete it and discard all saved state.
    errors:
      lxd_connection_failure: |-
        The provider was unable to contact the LXD daemon at %{api_endpoint}.
        
        It's possible that LXD isn't installed, or that it isn't configured to
        accept HTTPS connections from your machine. You can check whether HTTPS
        access is enabled with the following command:
        
            $ lxc config show core.https_address
        
        If the result is empty, you will need to correct the way LXD is
        configured before Vagrant can use it. This can be done with the
        following command:
        
            $ lxc config set core.https_address %{https_address}
        
        You can find more documentation about configuring LXD at:
        
            https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/#initial-configuration
        
      lxd_authentication_failure: |-
        The provider could not authenticate to the LXD daemon at %{api_endpoint}.
        
        You may need configure LXD to allow requests from this machine. The
        easiest way to do this is to add your LXC client certificate to LXD's
        list of trusted certificates. This can typically be done with the
        following command:
        
            $ lxc config trust add %{client_cert}
        
        You can find more information about configuring LXD at:

            https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/#initial-configuration
        
      lxd_operation_timeout: |-
        The container failed to respond within %{time_limit} seconds. Try
        running the following command to see whether an error occurs:
        
            $ lxc %{operation} %{machine_id}
        
        If that command runs successfully, there may be a bug in the LXD
        provider. If this is the case, please submit an issue at:
