        frozen: |-
          The VM is frozen. To start it, you can run `vagrant up`, or you can
          instead run `vagrant destroy` to delete it and discard all saved state.
        stopped: |-

    errors:
      lxd_connection_failure: |-
        The provider was unable to contact the LXD daemon at %{api_endpoint}.
        
        It's possible that LXD isn't installed, or that it isn't configured to
        accept HTTP connections from your machine. You can check whether HTTP
        access is enabled, and whether your machine is allowed to use it, with
        the following commands:
        
            $ lxc config show core.https_address
            $ lxc config trust list
        
        If either result is empty, you will need to correct the way LXD is
        configured before Vagrant can use it. This can be done with the
        following commands (it's safe to run them more than once):
        
            $ sudo service lxd start
            $ sudo lxd init --auto
            $ lxc config set core.https_address %{https_address}
            $ lxc config trust add %{client_cert}
        
      lxd_operation_timeout: |-
        The container failed to respond within %{time_limit} seconds. Try
        running the following command to see whether an error occurs:
        
            $ lxc %{operation} %{container_name}
        
        If that command runs successfully, there may be a bug in the LXD
        provider. If this is the case, please submit an issue at:
